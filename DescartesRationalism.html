          <p class="post-text">There has been a longstanding philosophical debate as to what the origin of the knowledge of synthetic propositions is. The reasons for understanding the source of propositional knowledge are numerous, the most important being that if one can identify the source or means to gain propositional knowledge, one can optimise their learning to gain this knowledge and the process to gain knowledge can be referenced in other areas of philosophy. There have been several theories formulated on this matter, of which two of the most prominent are empiricism and rationalism. The former argues that we have no a priori knowledge of synthetic propositions (and that all knowledge is gained via sense experience) whereas the latter argues that we have some a priori knowledge of synthetic propositions about the external world, and that we can gain this a priori knowledge through rational intuition and deduction rather than sense experience. This essay shall argue that Descartes’ rationalism is convincing on the grounds that it well defends the issues levelled at it by empiricists.</p>
          <p class="post-text">Descartes begins his construction of his new theory of rationalism by doubting all that is perceived. If we are being deceived by a supremely powerful evil demon, an anti-God as it were, our sense experience would appear to us to be correct and reliable – yet these perceptual experiences are merely fed to us by a deceiver and thus are false, yet would appear to be true. Therefore, we cannot trust our sense experience to be a source of propositional knowledge – we cannot form knowledge based on experiences that may not be true. This leads to the question as to what we can actually know to be true regardless of whether we are being deceived by an evil demon. In order to find this, one must avoid believing anything that is not completely certain and indubitable – in other words, anything that is inferred from perceptual experiences that may be false. This leads to the discarding of our senses, memories and bodies as possible to know, as they are all claims that would require perception to be established. However, as we are doubting these various claims, we know that we exist. We cannot doubt that we are doubting, as when we doubt we are thinking (doubting is a form of thinking) and thus when we doubt that we are doubting, we prove our own existence as a thinking thing that ‘doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wants, refuses, and also imagines and senses’. This is the cogito, the basis on which rationalism is founded. </p>
          <p class="post-text">This leads to Descartes’ method of rebuilding the knowledge that we cannot know from possibly false sense experience. In the cogito, there is a clear and distinct perception of what is asserted (clear meaning ‘present and accessible to the mind’ and distinct meaning ‘so sharply separated from all other ideas that every part of it is clear’). Furthermore, if this clarity and distinctness do not guarantee truth, then we cannot know that we exist. However, we do know that we exist and thus it logically follows that ‘as a general rule whatever I perceive very clearly and distinctly is true’. Our knowledge can therefore be restored entirely without reliance on sense experience by proving that the knowledge is clear and distinct.</p>
          <p class="post-text">It is important to note that the cogito is not without issues – furthermore, these issues are the most pressing to the theory of rationalism as the cogito is the basis for the entire theory. If the cogito is unsound, then rationalism entirely fails. Hume, one of the most prominent empiricists, levels the most pressing issue at the cogito – namely that Descartes assumes that he is a thinking thing, the same thinking thing from one thought to another. Hume argues that the demon may be deceiving us to believe that we are a thinking thing that persists between thoughts, but in reality we are merely a succession of thoughts rather than a single thinking thing. We only experience a continually changing array of thoughts and feelings and do not experience a persistent mental substance. Descartes has confused the similarity of his thoughts from one moment to another with identity by assuming that there is an identical thing persisting through our experiences, according to Hume. </p>
          <p class="post-text">However, it only makes sense that given the passive nature of thoughts, there must be a thinker thinking the thoughts for the thoughts to exist. Whilst it may be true that this same thinker does not continue to exist between one thought to another, there is always a thinker when there is a thought. As long as there is a thinker that thinks a thought, it does not matter if this thinker does not persist through different thoughts; the cogito still stands. When there is a thought, there is a thinker and this thinker is a thinking thing. This response strongly addresses Hume’s issue as it accepts Hume’s argument but equally turns it on its head and disproves it - Hume cannot effectively respond to this without contradicting his earlier argument as the response agrees with it, and thus Hume’s issue is dismissed and the cogito still stands, making rationalism seem all the more convincing.</p>
          <p class="post-text">With the cogito in place, knowledge can be proved as true without the need for sense experience as long as the knowledge is clear and distinct. Rationalism therefore needs to restore knowledge that empiricism takes to be true via sense experience, such as the existence of God and the existence of the external world. Descartes argues that God does exist and that his existence can be proved without sense experience. We have the concept God as the concept of something that is infinite and perfect. Because we are minds, we can create many ideas, including ideas of other people and physical objects. However, we are finite and imperfect beings whereas God is a concept of something infinite and perfect – thus God is a concept of something with more reality than my own mind. Descartes argues that ideas can only be caused by something that has as much reality as the idea, and the cause must have the same qualities as the idea. Therefore, because our minds do not have as much reality as the concept of God and our minds do not have the qualities of infinity and perfection, our minds cannot have created the concept of God. The only possible cause of this concept is something that is infinite and perfect, which is by definition God. So God causes my concept of God and thus God exists. This proof for the existence of God stands entirely without any reliance on sense experience and is formulated entirely through rational intuition, thus implying that we do have a priori knowledge of synthetic propositions and showing rationalism to be convincing.</p>
          <p class="post-text">This argument, however, is not without issues. It is possible to reject the claim that we cannot create the concept of God. Whilst it is true that we do not have the qualities of infinity and perfection, we do on the other hand have the qualities of finitude and imperfection. By extending these concepts of finitude and imperfection beyond their limits, we create the ideas of infinity and perfection as ideas of not finite and not imperfect. Thus, because we now have these concepts, we can create the concept God through this extension beyond all limits of what is already in our minds. However, rationalists can easily reject this issue as it has a fundamental flaw. By stating that we have the idea of imperfection, we imply that we know what perfection is in order to recognise that we do not have it. We cannot recognise that we are imperfect without already having the idea of perfection – this idea of perfection does not come from extending imperfection beyond its limit as imperfection depends on the already present concept of perfection; rather our concept of perfection is already present in us and is created by something is also perfect, namely God. This response strongly dismisses the issue that we can create the concept God from our minds, and thus rationalism has shown that we have a priori knowledge of the existence of God.</p>
          <p class="post-text">Rationalism then goes on to successfully restore the knowledge that was discarded as not completely certain due to reliance on potentially false sense experience. The knowledge that previously required sense experience to prove is shown to be true entirely through rational intuition, thus proving that we do have some a priori knowledge of synthetic propositions. Rationalism is convincing as it both successfully shows that our knowledge of synthetic propositions is a priori and it successfully and strongly defends the issues levelled against it by empiricists. As such, this essay concludes that rationalism is convincing and we do have a priori knowledge of synthetic propositions.</p>
