          <p class="post-text">Yesterday I completed the virtual work experience program run by HSBC; what a week!</p>
          <p class="post-text">I gained all sorts of useful information this week, ranging from tasters of each section of HSBC (Commercial Banking, Wealth and Personal Banking and Global Banking and Markets) to incredibly useful employability sessions run by Mark Hucklebridge, highlighting the importance of such skills as personal branding and networking.</p>
          <p class="post-text">These skills in particular are the most valuable pieces of advice that I will take away from this week - they are transferrable to any and all fields of work, yet woefully ignored by the schooling system and indeed other company insight events which I have had the privilege to be on.</p>
          <p class="post-text">There's only one thing that I would've changed this week; I wish more of my fellow participants would turn on their video or unmute, getting stuck into the discussion. Some of those breakout rooms felt like I was shouting into the abyss, and whilst I respect that some may not have working equipment, I still think that it would improve an already brilliant experience if the HSBC team encouraged people to unmute and engage in breakout rooms just a bit more.</p>
          <p class="post-text">All in all though, this week was a great learning opportunity. I'd recommend the program to:</p>
          <li class="post-text">Anyone who's interested in a career in fincancial services</li>
          <li class="post-text">Anyone who wants to find out if a career in financial services is for them</li>
          <li class="post-text">Anyone who wants to learn some incredibly useful transferrable skills</li>
          <p class="post-text">Many thanks to the HSBC Work Experience Team for such a great week!</p>
